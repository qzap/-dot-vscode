## Extension Settings

* `textmarker.highlightColors`

    List of colours to be used to highlight the selected text. The colours are used with respect to the order in the list.
    If it runs out of the colours, it uses the colour specified at `textmarker.defaultHighlightColor`.

* `textmarker.defaultHighlightColor` (default: `"gray"`)

    Once all the colours given in `textmarker.highlightColors` is used, texts are highlighted with this colour.

* `textmarker.defaultHighlightOpacity` (default: `0.7`)

    Opacity to be used when one is not given in the highlight colour. Opacity is also applied to the colours on the overview ruler.
    The value must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive.

* `textmarker.enableIgnoreCase` (default: `false`)

    Enable ignore case mode on startup

* `textmarker.enableWholeMatch` (default: `false`)

    Enable whole match mode on startup

* `textmarker.useHighlightColorOnRuler` (default: `true`)

    Use the same colour for both highlighting a text and showing the location on the ruler.
    
    If you have multiple highlights on the same line and their colours have opacity `1`,
    you would only see one of those colours. You can specify a smaller opacity value so that the colours can be blended.

* `textmarker.autoSelectDistinctiveTextColor` (default: `false`)

    Text colour will be chosen to be distinctive from the background highlight colour.
    This will hide the text colour given by syntax highlighting; if this is not desirable, set it `false`.
    
* `textmarker.hideStatusBarItems` (default: `false`)

    Hide status bar items. When set it `true`, the buttons to switch the modes of partial/whole match and
    case sensitive/insensitive match will not be displayed.

* `textmarker.delayForRefreshingHighlight` (default: `300`)

    Number of milliseconds to wait before refreshing the highlights on editor contents change. `null` for no refresh.

* `textmarker.commandsOnContextMenu` (default: 4 commands are visible. See them [here](https://github.com/ryu1kn/vscode-text-marker/blob/c8fcadd3b9271b46c7de1b15c776e6d4889aa35e/package.json#L109))

    Commands appear on the context menu. For historical reason, 4 commands are visible by default.

    For example, if you:

    * Do NOT want to see **Update Highlight** command (Command ID: `textmarker.updateHighlight`), which is on the menu by default
    * Want to see **Clear All Highlights** (Command ID: `textmarker.clearAllHighlight`), which is NOT on the menu by default

    You can set this setting like this:

    ```
    "textmarker.commandsOnContextMenu": {
      "updateHighlight": false,
      "clearAllHighlight": true
    }
    ```

* `textmarker.savedHighlights`

    List of highlights that will get applied when opening editor.
    This value is typically set/updated by "**Save All Highlights**" command.

    Different levels of settings (user settings, workspace settings) are not merged; so the most specific settings wins.

    Sample `savedHighlights`:

    ```
    "textmarker.savedHighlights": [
      {
        "pattern": {
          "type": "regex",
          "expression": "(TODO|XXX|HACK): .*",
          "ignoreCase": false,
          "wholeMatch": true
        },
        "color": "skyblue"
      },
      {
        "pattern": {
          "type": "string",
          "expression": "NOTE",
          "ignoreCase": false,
          "wholeMatch": false
        },
        "color": "yellow"
      },
      ...
    ]
    ```

* `textmarker.enableTelemetry` (default: `true`)
    
    Allow the extension usage data to be sent to the extension author.

    Text Marker sends usage data only when both `textmarker.enableTelemetry` and `telemetry.enableTelemetry` are set to `true`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can quickly invoke the above TextMarker commands by registering them to your keyboard shortcut settings. For example:

```json
  { "key": "ctrl+h", "command": "textmarker.toggleHighlight", "when": "editorTextFocus" }
```

## Telemetry

Text Marker collects usage data and send it to the extension author to help improve the extension.
If you don't want usage data to be collected, you can set the `textmarker.enableTelemetry` setting to `false`.

If you're setting VS Code's `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting to `false`,
regardless of the value of `textmarker.enableTelemetry`, Text Marker will not collect usage data.
