Inspired by the [clean architecture tutorial](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/27/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-1-explanation-project-structure/) by [reso coder](https://github.com/ResoCoder), this extension will help you quickly scaffold a feature.

For example, let's take the counter feature:
