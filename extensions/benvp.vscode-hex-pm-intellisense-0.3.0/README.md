# vscode-hex-pm-intellisense README

This Package adds IntelliSense for hex.pm dependencies in your Elixir project Mixfile. It uses the hex.pm API to receive the versions according to the current package.

The extension is in an early stage, so there is plenty of room for improvements. Contributions are welcome. ðŸ™‚

## Why?

Because it bugged me, that I always have to go to hex.pm first to check for the available versions of a package. With this handy extension, you can directly see all available versions.

## How does it look?

## Requirements

Should not have any dependencies. However using the fabulous ElixirLS or vscode-elixir plugin would help. But I think you will have it already installed anyway.

## Extension Settings

None - as for now.

## Known Issues

None - as for now.
