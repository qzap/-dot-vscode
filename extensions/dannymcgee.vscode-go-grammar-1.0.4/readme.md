# Go Grammar

This extension provides a highly detailed VSCode TextMate grammar for Go. The TextMate scopes are mostly borrowed from Microsoft's TypeScript grammar, so it should work out-of-the-box with your favorite theme.

Do note that some of the highlights aren't _quite_ right due to the limits of TextMate's grammar format (and the limits of my patience ðŸ™‚), particularly around variables vs packages vs types. If this sort of thing bugs you as much as it bugs me, you can install my [patched version of gopls](https://github.com/dannymcgee/golang-tools/tree/semantic-tokens) to fix it.
